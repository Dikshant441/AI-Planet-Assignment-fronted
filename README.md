## Objective


Build a hackathon app where one can create a hackathon & see the list.

## Overview

Imagine you are working for an Edtech company and you are asked to create
a simple application that will allow to create a hackathon and seek participation to get
solutions. The hackathon consists of a problem statement, which can be accessed by
participants to solve and make a submission. Here let’s imagine those who create a
hackathon as organizers and those who can take part in it as “participant(s)”. Now as
As a developer, you are asked to create a dashboard for the organizer to create a hackathon.

## Application overview

Oragnizers should be able to create, edit, and delete hackathons.
  Every hackathon should contain the following data:
    - Name
    - Start date 
    End date
    - Description
    - Image
    Level (easy, hard, medium)

- Organizers should be able to see list of hackathons created, sort, search, filter and preview. 
  - Organizers should also be able to sort the challenges (newest first and oldest first), filter using level (easy, medium, hard) and status (active, upcoming, past), and search hackathon using the name.
  Active hackathons card should have a timer that will show when it will end.
The Upcoming hackathons card should have a timer that will show when it will start.
  Past hackathons card should have a start & end date.
  When clicked on the hackathon, it should take the user to the page where the user can see all the data related to hackathon.
    On this page, there should be an edit & delete button.
